<b>Cedar Performance</b>
<br />
Cedar is the natural choice because of its beauty, practicality and durability. We use only the finest cedar to create furniture that lasts for generations. It is naturally resistant to decay, insect and weather damage. Because of this superior resistance, cedar is frequently used for outdoor fencing and siding on homes. Cedar has an exceptionally high strength-to-weight ratio, which means that it is both durable and easy to move about. It does not shrink or warp as many other woods commonly do. Unlike pressure-treated wood furniture, we use no chemical preservatives that may be harmful to your family's health.

<b>Checking Process</b>

<br />

<b>Types of Cedar</b>
<br />
We use two types of cedar -- Northern White Cedar for our indoor and outdoor furniture for its creamy white color and enduring strength, and Western Red Cedar for our outdoor garden products such as arbors and trellises. When left untreated, over time white cedar weathers gracefully to a silvery gray, or it can be stained to match any décor.
<br />
<br />
All cedar log furniture is subject to the natural process of checking as the wood seasons. Checking occurs as wood releases moisture across or through the annual growth rings and it does not affect the structural performance or integrity of the wood.
<br />
<br />
This checking looks like a crack but is perfectly natural and should the Skichair actually break we will replace it ASAP!  But it will NOT break.

<b>How To Care For Your Cedar Wood Furniture</b>
<br />
Northern White and Western Red Cedar are some of the most sought—after woods, ideal for many outdoor and indoor uses. It is a fine grained wood that is durable and resistant to rotting and insects. Because cedar is a top choice for carefree living, it can be left natural or it can be painted or stained to match any décor.
<br />
<br />
Left untreated, both Western Red and Northern White Cedar will weather to a beautiful soft silvery gray. Untreated cedar is natural and pleasing, however, the wood is porous and over the long term may become discolored if left in damp or shaded areas. A 20 percent solution of household bleach in water with one ounce of detergent per gallon will usually remove the stain. Even after years of exposure, cedar can be refinished to its natural bright clean appearance.

<br />

If you opt to stain your cedar furniture, there are a wide variety of penetrating stains. We recommend Penofin because it is formulated to enhance the natural beauty of the wood and will keep it looking that way. Some stains also have water repellant additives and mildew inhibitors. Penetrating stains go into the wood without forming a surface barrier. This eliminates the problems of blistering and peeling of painted surfaces. They work well on wood with knots and deep surface texture. Whichever stain you opt to use, please follow the manufacturer's directions for a successful application.
<br />
<br />
If you decide to paint cedar, the natural color and grain of the wood will be concealed. So many great colors are now available to accent your décor. Our furniture is also popular with artists who paint flowers, natural scenes, or whimsical patterns right on the furniture. Follow the directions on the manufacturer's product for the best application methods.
