                    There are two ways to use your old skis.  First you could do it yourself by sending for our Ski Pans. You could make it even easier if you sent for our Wood Kit as well.  The easiest of all is for you to send us your skis and the Skichair Masters can assemble you a beautiful Skichair in only a couple of weeks.
