                <b>25 lb BENCH PIECES</b><br />
                Benches will receive 2 Bench Legs and may arrive separately do to Drop Shipping direct from factory.  Depending on your bench you will have 2 Boards, a top and a Bottom, or 4 to 8 skis numbered from the bottom up if needed.  Make sure not to drive the screws through the Board or Skis, use your torque adjustment on the drill and set cordless drill on 3 on a scale 1-5.
                <br /><br />
                <b>How to assemble your 25lb Bench or Table/Seat:</b><br />
                1.                   The Skis or Boards are pre-drilled with hardware in the box.  The most difficult part of assembling the 25lb bench is making sure both legs are straight and parallel to each other.  This is done by using a tape measure.  Note:  It is best if the Skis are placed such that they are all pointing in the same direction so the logos and lettering can be read.<br /><br />
                2.                   Make sure the holes from the Skis or Boards are lined up in the middle of each leg (the Pre drilled holes in the legs are for a different application!).  Then, attach the Skis or Boards to the BOTTOM Legs first with 1 screw in each side.  This is the Seat portion of the Bench.  Then place the top Ski/Board putting just 1 screw in each side of each Board/Ski.  By putting 1 screw and not over tightening the screws allows you to make the Bench legs square! <br /><br />
                3.                   Then place the Skis or Boards in a uniform distance from one another, again insert 1 screw on each side.  This allows you to Move the Legs to get them even.   The bench Leg ends do not have to be pre-drilled and can be screwed and unscrewed a number of times.  Make sure not to drive the screws through the Boards or Skis.<br /><br />
                4.                   Now your Bench is complete.  Be sure to relax, call all your friends telling them that you can now rest in style!
                <br /><br />
                <b>How to assemble a handmade Skichair:</b><br />
                Now that the box is open Layout items as they are depicted in the picture of the Skichair and Ottoman Figure 1.  Enclosed you will find  stainless steel screws plus a #2 square head bit to be used in an electric or cordless drill.  Be sure to have the clutch adjusted so that the screws are not embedded too far into the wood. This is usually 3 on a 1-5 scale.  Apply wood glue to all wood pieces that are fastened together.
                <br /><br />
                1.                   Attach the Skichair Back Rest labeled C to the Skichair Base labeled A.  Place Back Rest C to the back edge of the notch located in Base A.    Screw into place and when attached be careful not to rock the back rest because it can crack.<br /><br />
                2.                   Attach both Skichair Legs labeled I with the slot facing out to the Skichair base A.   This is done by partially driving 2 screws into leg I, where there are a cluster of 4 holes, so they stick out the other side and can be lined up to the receiving holes in Base A.<br /><br />
                3.                   Attach both Skichair Arm Supports labeled G to the slots on the Skichair Legs labeled I.  Note: Make sure they are perfectly flush with the top of both Legs.<br /><br />
                4.                  Attach the Skichair Arm labeled H to the Skichair Back Arm Bracket labeled E and to the Front Legs labeled I.   Note: There should be 6 countersunk holes in each arm and should be facing up, or towards you. Once you have determined the Right and Left Arms, drive in the furthest screw at the back of the Arm H to the furthest receiving hole on the Back Arm Bracket E already attached to the Back Rest.  Next, drive in the Front Screw that goes into the center of Arm Support G.  Note: The Arm will have to be centered on the bottom edge of Leg I so that the remaining 2 holes are centered into Leg I and the other hole centered on Arm Support G. <br /><br />
                5.         Your chair is complete, sit down and read how to assemble the Skichair Ottoman.
                <br /><br />
                <b>How to assemble the handmade Ottoman:</b><br />
                1.                   Attach the Ottoman Front Legs labeled J to the Ottoman Back Legs labeled L.  This is done by partially driving 2 screws so the stick out the other side and then can be lined up to receiving holes in the ottoman Front legs labeled J.  The 4 screws go through the Back Legs L into the Front Legs J.  See Figure 1.<br /><br />
                2.                   Next, attach the Ottoman Cross Brace Labeled M to the Ottoman Back Legs labeled L.  This is done by positioning the Ottoman Cross Brace M as high up on the legs as possible.<br /><br />
                3.                   If the Skis or Board needs to be attached now is the time to do it.  Place the Ottoman on an angle by propping up the front of the ottoman legs so the top of the ottoman is level.  Next, evenly place the Skis or Board onto the ottoman and screw them into place.  Note: Wake Boards require washes and should be used at this point.   If the ottoman is rocking, check the Screws that hold the Skis or Board in place.  Sometimes you might have to loosen some of the Screws on the Skis or Board because of the curvature of the Skis or Board to prevent rocking.<br /><br />
                4.                   Now your Skichair is now complete.  Be sure to relax call all your friends and telling them that you can now rest in style!
