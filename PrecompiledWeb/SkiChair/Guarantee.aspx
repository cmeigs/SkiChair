                Hi, My name's Dr. Michael Chartoff and I'm the owner/chiropractor at Boston Chiropractic Associates located in Boston, MA.  I've seen and used many of the products at SkiChair.com.  They provide great back support and are well-designed, ergonomically fit chairs and benches that also express a certain lifestyle.  If you want to relax in style, but still take care of your body, try one out.  
                <br /><br />
                Yours in Health, <br />
